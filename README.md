Ringa is a Javascript state and action framework designed with no global model, no global controllers, the simplicity of proven dependency injection, and asynchronous action trees.

It was designed primarily for ReactJS and eliminates the need for the container/component pattern.

*Note: Ringa is very much in alpha stage and a couple applications are being built on top of it. As such, it will be in a state of flux (no pun intended) for the next few months.*
