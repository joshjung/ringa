# Demo

## Introduction

This RingaJS demo is a large demonstration of some of the best features of RingaJS integrated with a live server. Feel free to dig through the code and 
play around with the application, but keep in mind the codebase was not designed as a "Hello World" equivalent. If you are just getting started, take a look at the examples in [Home](http://www.ringajs.com/).
