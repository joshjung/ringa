# Welcome to RingaJS

RingaJS is an enterprise level single page application (SPA) framework that includes:

1. **MVC / MVVM Hybrid Architecture**
2. **State management** with no singletons
3. Performance centered **Observer Pattern**
4. **Dependency injection to React Components**
5. **Asynchronous toolset** with branching, looping, and error handling
6. Customizable **Error Management**
7. Heavy focus on **performance, modularity, and scalability**

While not built for React, RingaJS integrates with your React application through the `react-ringa` plugin.

## Background

RingaJS was built in my spare time the last year as a way to shift the most difficult
concepts of rapid application development into a library to improve my own personal development speed. It was also designed as a way to organize enterprise
applications in a way that made it extremely easy to monitor teams as they work in a growing codebase.
