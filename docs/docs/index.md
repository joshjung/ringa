# Welcome to RingaJS

## What is it

RingaJS is a single page application framework that includes:

1. **MVC / MVVM hybrid** structure with little boilerplate
2. **State management** with no singletons
3. Performance centered **observer pattern**
4. **Dependency injection**
4. **Asynchronous toolset** with branching, looping, and error handling

It is hard to explain what Ringa is in a single sentence because it just does so much. This was built in my spare time the last year as a way to shift all the most difficult
concepts to rapid application development into a core set of Classes to improve my own development speed. It was also designed as a way to organize large enterprise
applications in a way that made it extremely easy to monitor large teams as they work in a growing codebase.

Ringa's philosophy can be summed up with a few mantras:

* Shield new developers from concepts they do not need to know... yet
* Let seasoned developers configure or extend anything
* Give everyone easy to understand error messages and warnings
* Never sacrifice performance
* No fancy string parsing for observers
* Give developers 100% control over their observables

## Latest Version
