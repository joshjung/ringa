Building a Ringa \nModel\n\n\nTo construct a Ringa Model, you just need to extend \nModel\n and add some properties:\n\n\nimport {Model} from 'ringa';\n\nclass HelloWorldModel extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('helloWorldText', 'Hello World!');\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nOr, if you want to use the shorthand:\n\n\nconst HelloWorldModel = Model.construct('HelloWorldModel', [{\n  name: 'helloWorldText',\n  default: 'Hello World!'\n}]);\n\n\n\nUnder the hood, Ringa creates custom getters and setters for each property on your model. In addition\nit can store custom options for each property. These getters, setters, and options allow Ringa to perform\nits fancy magic.\n\n\n2. Building a Ringa \nController\n\n\nControllers in Ringa link Models to your view. They also link Models to your control / asynchronous code. In many ways the Controllers in Ringa work like a traditional MVC controller (with a couple major game-changing differences which we will explain later).\n\n\nIn any case, here is a basic example of a bare-bones Controller that does virtually nothing:\n\n\nimport {Controller} from 'ringa';\n\nclass HelloWorldController extends Controller {\n  constructor(name, bus, options) {\n    super(name, bus, options);\n\n    this.addModel(new HelloWorldModel());\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThis controller really does not do much. It simply \"holds\" a reference to a single instance of our super fancy and magical hello world model.\n\n\nIt's really okay if you are not impressed yet.\n\n\n3. Attach a \nController\n to your view\n\n\nNote: Ringa does not depend on React, but in the current version React is the only plugin being developed so you must suffer if you love Vue or something. But quite frankly after seeing how well Ringa works with React at keeping things clean, you might give up your current framework.\n\n\nAnd now, let us attach our beautiful Controller to an equally vapid React Component:\n\n\nimport {attach} from 'react-ringa';\n\nclass HelloWorld extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    attach(this, new HelloWorldController());\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return \ndiv\nThis doesn't really do anything.\n/div\n;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAt this point we are nearly 90% of the way to recreating Facebook! Pat yourself on the back.\n\n\n4. Inject your \nModel\n into the View\n\n\nOne of the most powerful features of Ringa, and in particular \nreact-ringa\n, is that a view component can request any Model by its type or its name. \nreact-ringa\n will look\nthrough its parent hierarchy for all controllers, and ask those controllers if they have an instance of the requested \nModel\n. If they do, the one \nclosest\n to the current Component is returned:\n\n\nimport {depend, dependency} from 'react-ringa';\n\nclass HelloWorld extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    depend(this, dependency(HelloWorldModel)); // Ask for an instance of HelloWorldModel\n\n    attach(this, new HelloWorldController()); // Attach the Controller (which has the instance)\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return \ndiv\nThis starting to do something...\n/div\n;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIn this case, our \nHelloWorld\n component will search for the first instance of \nHelloWorldModel\n that it can find. First it looks for all Ringa Controllers within itself or its ancestors. It finds \nHelloWorldController\n, attached to itself like a barnacle. Then it searches\nthrough all of the available \nModels\n that are added to those Controllers (in our case only the \nHelloWorldController\n). It returns the first one it finds... the one that is closest in the view stack to the current Component. In this case it finds our instance of \nHelloWorldModel\n that\nwe added to our \nHelloWorldController\n.\n\n\nWhen Ringa finds a matching \nModel\n it uses the name of the \nModel\n and injects that into the Component's state object:\n\n\nimport {depend, dependency} from 'react-ringa';\n\nclass HelloWorld extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    // Note that all Ringa Models by default have a name that is the camelcase\n    // of the Class name, so this would be named 'helloWorldModel'\n    depend(this, dependency(HelloWorldModel));\n\n    attach(this, new HelloWorldController());\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // Here our instance has been injected into the state\n    const {helloWorldModel} = this.state;\n\n    return \ndiv\n{helloWorldModel.helloWorldText}\n/div\n;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nYou may ask why we inject into \nstate\n and not \nprops\n. This was a complicated decision. Some other frameworks like Redux get around the immutability of \nprops\n by wrapping every single component that uses \nconnect\n with \nanother\n React Component so they can inject the \nstore\n.\n\n\nI just personally decided this felt silly to wrap every component in another component to work around a design decision and \nstate\n worked so I ran with it. We can discuss the philosophical ramifications of this decision later but for now it works super well.\n\n\n5. Refresh the Display When a Property Changes on a Model\n\n\nNow, clearly displaying hello world is not enough. We may, in fact, need at some point to say goodbye to the world. Perhaps it is because it is covered in a dense layer of Venusian gasses and infected with a wildly popular orange alien who keeps spewing them.\n\n\nWhatever your personal reasons may be for leaving this planet, Ringa makes it easy (in this particular example):\n\n\nimport {depend, dependency} from 'react-ringa';\n\nclass HelloWorld extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    depend(this, dependency(HelloWorldModel, 'helloWorldText'));\n\n    attach(this, new HelloWorldController());\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // Now the property *and* the model are injected into state.\n    const {helloWorldText} = this.state;\n\n    return \ndiv\n\n      {helloWorldText}\n      \nbutton onClick={this.goodbyeWorld}\nHej D\u00e5!\n/button\n\n    \n/div\n;\n  }\n\n  goodbyeWorld() {\n    this.state.helloWorldModel.helloWorldText = 'Goodbye, earth!';\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAfter close scrutiny you might have noticed that in this example we are now watching, specifically, the \nhelloWorldText\n property on our model. What this means is that whenever that property changes, we force the component to rerender itself and inject that property\ninto the state object.\n\n\n6. Quick, and Painless, Refactoring our View\n\n\nAt this point, you may wonder what all the fuss is about. You see, Ringa's power does not lie just in its low boilerplate, intuitive dependency injection, or fast observer pattern. It lies in the flexibility of restructuring your view on the fly while having to adjust the least amount of code. Moving things around and refactoring your view\nis insanely easy:\n\n\nclass HelloWorldText extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    depend(this, dependency(HelloWorldModel, 'helloWorldText'));\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const {helloWorldText} = this.state;\n\n    return \ndiv\n{helloWorldText}\n/div\n;\n  }\n}\n\nclass HelloWorld extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    attach(this, new HelloWorldController());\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const {helloWorldText} = this.state;\n\n    return \ndiv\n\n      \nHelloWorldText /\n // \n--- Take a look here\n      \nbutton onClick={this.goodbyeWorld}\nGo to Mars with Elon Musk\n/button\n\n    \n/div\n;\n  }\n\n  goodbyeWorld() {\n    this.state.helloWorldModel.helloWorldText = 'Goodbye, earth!';\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nBut wait, how... how does \nHelloWorldText\n know what instance of the \nHelloWorldModel\n it is supposed to use?\n\n\nNote the \nTake a look here\n comment. On that line, we create an instance of \nHelloWorldText\n. The ancestor of that instance (\nHelloWorld\n) contains a Controller that has an instance of our \nHelloWorldModel\n. So \ndepend\n easily finds an instance to inject!\n\n\nWhile at first this may be confusing, it naturally allows you to structure the tree of your view in a highly reusable and scalable way.\n\n\n7. Dispatching and Handling Asynchronous Events\n\n\nSetting properties on Models is great and all, but our application does - at some point - need to actually do something. And nobody is going to buy that our trip to mars only took like 0 milliseconds.\n\n\nFirst, we need to update our Controller so that it can receive events:\n\n\nimport {Controller} from 'ringa';\n\nclass HelloWorldController extends Controller {\n  constructor(name, bus, options) {\n    super(name, bus, options);\n\n    this.addModel(new HelloWorldModel());\n\n    this.addListener('goToMars', [\n      this.updateMessage('Traveling to Mars!'),\n      1000, // Wait 1000 ms\n      this.updateMessage('Getting really bored...'),\n      5000, // Wait 5000 ms\n      this.updateMessage('Perhaps hibernation should have been invented.'),\n      10000, // Wait 10000 ms\n      this.updateMessage('Finally, we have arrived!!'),\n    ]);\n  }\n\n  updateMessage(text) {\n    return (helloWorldModel) =\n {\n      helloWorldModel.helloWorldText = text;\n    };\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nSecond, we are going to create create Form and have it dispatch an event:\n\n\nimport {dispatch} from 'ringa';\n\nclass HelloWorldForm extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return \nbutton ref=\"button\" onClick={() =\n {this.onClick()}}\nBlast off!\n/button\n;\n  }\n\n  onClick() {\n    dispatch(HelloWorldController.GO_TO_MARS, {}, this.refs.button);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAnd that is it! Dispatching in Ringa dispatches \nthrough\n the DOM. Since all Controllers are attached to a DOM node (the root DOM node of a React Component in this case) then they can catch\nany events (including DOM events like \n'click'\n) that can be passed through the DOM. So in our \nHelloWorldForm\n we dispatch the event, it bubbles up through to be caught by our single instance of\nthe \nHelloWorldController\n.\n\n\nNote in \naddListener\n that we provide an array of functions and numbers.

If they do, the one  closest  to the current Component is returned:  import {depend, dependency} from 'react-ringa';\n\nclass HelloWorld extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    depend(this, dependency(HelloWorldModel)); // Ask for an instance of HelloWorldModel\n\n    attach(this, new HelloWorldController()); // Attach the Controller (which has the instance)\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return  div This starting to do something... /div ;\n  }\n}  In this case, our  HelloWorld  component will search for the first instance of  HelloWorldModel  that it can find. First it looks for all Ringa Controllers within itself or its ancestors. It finds  HelloWorldController , attached to itself like a barnacle. Then it searches\nthrough all of the available  Models  that are added to those Controllers (in our case only the  HelloWorldController ). It returns the first one it finds... the one that is closest in the view stack to the current Component. In this case it finds our instance of  HelloWorldModel  that\nwe added to our  HelloWorldController .  When Ringa finds a matching  Model  it uses the name of the  Model  and injects that into the Component's state object:  import {depend, dependency} from 'react-ringa';\n\nclass HelloWorld extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    // Note that all Ringa Models by default have a name that is the camelcase\n    // of the Class name, so this would be named 'helloWorldModel'\n    depend(this, dependency(HelloWorldModel));\n\n    attach(this, new HelloWorldController());\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // Here our instance has been injected into the state\n    const {helloWorldModel} = this.state;\n\n    return  div {helloWorldModel.helloWorldText} /div ;\n  }\n}  You may ask why we inject into  state  and not  props . This was a complicated decision. Some other frameworks like Redux get around the immutability of  props  by wrapping every single component that uses  connect  with  another  React Component so they can inject the  store .  I just personally decided this felt silly to wrap every component in another component to work around a design decision and  state  worked so I ran with it.

Function Argument Injection\n\n\nThere are several rules that are followed when performing all function injections in Ringa JS:\n\n\n\n\nFunction injection always injects by name\n\n\nOrder of arguments does not matter\n\n\nRinga JS will always warn you in the console if a property could not be found for injection\n\n\n\n\nLimitations:\n\n\n\n\nYou cannot currently use defaults (e.g. \n(f = 0) =\n {}\n) when performing injections due to the various ways that different transpilers treat this code. I spent a good 4-6 hours trying to figure out how to do this and gave up.\n\n\n\n\n1.1. Executor Event Detail Injection\n\n\nimport {Controller} from 'ringa'\n\nclass MyController extends Controller {\n  constructor(name, options) {\n    super(name, options);\n\n    this.addListener('saySomething', (message) =\n {\n      console.log(message);\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\nimport {dispatch} from 'ringa';\n\ndispatch('saySomething', {\n  message: 'I will be injected!'\n}, document);\n\n\n\nYou will notice that the property has been injected by its name \nmessage\n.\n\n\nEvery key in the detail object is available for injection in every executor.\n\n\n1.2. Executor \nModel\n Injection\n\n\nAs we have seen in 1.2, executors can request \nRingaEvent\n details be injected by their name. Executors can request \nModel\n objects be injected by name as well. \n\n\nPlease note that all Ringa JS \nModel\n instances by default have their \nname\n set to the camelcase of their class name. As a result, when\nyou create and add a \nModel\n to a \nController\n, that model can be injected by its default name. For example, if your model is named \nCarModel\n you can\nuse \naddModel\n to attach the model to your Controller and then inject it by its default camelcase name \ncarModel\n.\n\n\nimport {Controller, Model} from 'ringa'\n\nconst CarModel = Model.construct('CarModel', ['brand', 'type', 'color', 'state']);\nconst DriverModel = Model.construct('DriverModel', ['name', 'skill']);\n\nclass CarController extends Controller {\n  constructor(name, options) {\n    super(name, options);\n\n    this.addModel(new CarModel());\n    this.addModel(new DriverModel('Joshua'));\n\n    this.addListener('startDriving', (carModel) =\n {\n      carModel.state = 'driving';\n    });\n\n    this.addListener('brakeSuddenly', (carModel, Joshua) =\n {\n      if (Joshua.skill === 0) {\n        carModel.state = 'crashed';\n      } else {\n        carModel.state = 'stopped';\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIn this example, we see that \ncarModel\n and \nJoshua\n can be injected easily by either the default name or the custom name.\n\n\n1.3. Event Chaining and Injections\n\n\nIn Ringa JS, one \nController\n executor chain can trigger another. When this happens, all the injections that were available in the original dispatched event are also available in the executors responding to the secondary dispatched event:\n\n\nimport {Controller, Model, event} from 'ringa'\n\nclass ConsoleController extends Controller {\n  constructor(name, options) {\n    super(name, options);\n\n    // Ringa JS automatically creates ConsoleController.LOG\n    this.addListener('log', message =\n {console.log(message);});\n  }\n}\n\nclass MessageController extends Controller {\n  constructor(name, options) {\n    super(name, options);\n\n    // Ringa JS automatically creates MessageController.SAY_SOMETHING\n    this.addListener('saySomething', event(ConsoleController.LOG));\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\n// Assuming the above controllers have been attached to the document...\ndispatch(MessageController.SAY_SOMETHING, {\n  message: 'Woohoo, this gets passed through to ConsoleController!'\n}, document);\n\n\n\nOne huge architectural advantage of this system is that controllers can function as interfaces to other generic implementations.\n\n\nBut what if there is a name collision somewhere in the chain, like this:\n\n\nimport {Controller, Model, event} from 'ringa'\n\nclass ConsoleController extends Controller {\n  constructor(name, options) {\n    super(name, options);\n\n    this.addListener('log', (message, $ringaEvent, $lastEvent) =\n {\n      console.log(message);                       // Message 2!\n      console.log($ringaEvent.lastEvent.detail.message); // Message 1!\n      console.log($lastEvent.detail.message);            // Message 1!\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nclass MessageController extends Controller {\n  constructor(name, options) {\n    super(name, options);\n\n    this.addListener('saySomething', event(ConsoleController.LOG, {\n      message: 'Message 2!' // Uh oh, the name 'message' collides with our 'message' below!\n    }));\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\n// Assuming the above controllers have been attached to the document...\ndispatch(MessageController.SAY_SOMETHING, {\n  message: 'Message 1!'\n}, document);\n\n\n\nRinga JS always retains all contextual information even in a naming conflict. If you dispatch an event that overrides a name that was provided in the original event you can still access the original variable through either \n$ringaEvent.lastEvent\n or \n$lastEvent\n.\n\n\n1.4. Promise Injection\n\n\nEvery time you call \ndispatch()\n a \nRingaEvent\n object is created and returned. The \nRingaEvent\n object functions like a promise and you can request injections in your \nthen\n or \ncatch\n:\n\n\nimport {Controller, Model, event} from 'ringa'\n\nconst UserModel = Model.construct('UserModel', ['name']);\n\nclass UserController extends Controller {\n  constructor(name, options) {\n    super(name, options);\n\n    this.addModel(new UserModel());\n\n    this.addListener('getUser', [\n      // Do some complex server call\n    ]);\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\n// userModel is injected because it exists on the handling controller\ndispatch(UserController.GET_USER, {}, document).then(userModel =\n {\n  console.log(`${userModel.name} has been successfully retrieved!`);\n});\n\n\n\n1.5. Built in Injections\n\n\nRinga JS by default provides several built-in variables that can be injected at any time:\n\n\n\n\n$controller\n: The controller that caught and is currently handling the event.\n\n\n$thread\n: The internal thread object that is currently managing the executors for the event.\n\n\n$ringaEvent\n: The original \nRingaEvent\n that was dispatched.\n\n\nevent\n: If a DOM event (like \nclick\n or \nmouseover\n) triggered the executor chain, then this would be the DOM event. Note that all DOM events that are caught by Ringa \nController\n are wrapped in a \nRingaEvent\n before the executors are run.\n\n\n$lastEvent\n: If one \nRingaEvent\n chain triggers another (e.g. by using \nevent()\n) then you can access the prior events via \n$lastEvent\n. These are chained together so if an event triggers 3 executor chains, then \n$lastEvent.lastEvent.lastEvent\n would be valid.\n\n\n$customEvent\n: Accesses the DOM \nCustomEvent\n object that is used to dispatch the \nRingaEvent\n through the DOM nodes.\n\n\n$target\n: The target DOM node that dispatched the event.\n\n\n$detail\n: The event detail object. Useful if you want to add new properties or for some reason cannot inject the properties by name.\n\n\ndone\n: Only available in a function executor. A function to call when the executor has been completed. Similar to \nMocha\n or \nJest\n unit tests.\n\n\nfail\n: Similar to done, except triggers a failure of the executor chain.\n\n\nstop\n: Useful for debugging. Stops the executor and outputs information to the console, where you can start the executor chain again.\n\n\nresume\n: Resume the executor chain.\n\n\n$lastPromiseResult\n: If \nany\n previous executor returned a promise that completed, the result will be contained here.\n\n\n$lastPromiseError\n: If \nany\n previous executor returned a promise that errored, the error will be contained here.\n\n\n\n\n1.6. Custom Injections\n\n\nCustom injection values can be added easily to the \noptions.injections\n object:\n\n\nimport {Controller, Model, event} from 'ringa'\n\nclass DudeController extends Controller {\n  constructor(name, options) {\n    super(name, options);\n\n    this.options.injections.someCustomValue = 'I just have to find a cash machine...';\n\n    this.addListener('doSomething', ...);\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\ndispatch(DudeController.DO_SOMETHING, {}, document).then(someCustomValue =\n {\n  console.log(someCustomValue);\n});\n\n\n\n1.7. Preparing for Production (Uglify)\n\n\nWhen preparing production code, your variable names will be uglified. As a result, you need to add the list of injected variable names to the blacklist for \nUglifyJS\n:\n\n\nplugins: [\n  new webpack.DefinePlugin({\n    __DEV__: false\n  }),\n  new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({\n    sourceMap: true,\n    mangle: {\n      except: [\n        '$controller',\n        '$thread',\n        '$ringaEvent',\n        'event',\n        '$customEvent',\n        '$lastEvent',\n        '$target',\n        '$detail',\n        'done',\n        'fail',\n        '$lastPromiseResult',\n        '$lastPromiseError'\n        ...]\n    }\n  })\n]\n\n\n\nBut how do you know what they are?\n\n\nWhen in \n__DEV__: true\n mode, Ringa JS keeps track of every single variable that has been injected and builds a whilelist for you.\n\n\nTo view all the injections you need to add to the \nmangle\n property of \nUglifyJS\n, after you have run your application and all of its various executors go to the browser console:\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that because a lot of the injections that can occur in Ringa JS are dynamic, it is impossible to know before running each executor which variable names will need to avoid mangling.",

Overview\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the \nreact-ringa\n plugin is to assist in dependency injection of \nModel\n objects to your React Components and to intelligently rerender them when dependencies change.\n\n\n2. Dependency Injection\n\n\nWhen using React via the \nreact-ringa\n plugin, there are a couple ways that a React Component can access to (and watch) a Ringa JS \nModel\n instance.\n\n\nFirst you will want to make a \nModel\n available for injection:\n\n\n\n\nattach(component, model)\n: use when you want to directly attach a \nModel\n instance to a Component. This will make the \nModel\n \navailable\n to the Component and all its descendants for injection. This does not do the injection directly.\n\n\n\n\nRequest a \nModel\n (or its properties) to be injected into a Component's \nstate\n in one of two ways:\n\n\n\n\ndepend(component, dependencies[])\n: use when you expect an ancestor to provide a \nModel\n and need to watch its properties and have them injected. If properties are injected, \ndepend\n ensures that the \nstate\n of the React Component accurately reflects any changes in the \nModel\n.\n\n\nwatch(component, model, properties = [])\n: if you already have access to the \nModel\n instance, you can use watch instead of \ndepend()\n.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.

Request a \nModel\n Dependency Injection from a Component\n\n\ndepend(component, dependencies[])\n\n\nThis function searches for instances that match its list of dependencies, injects them into the React \nComponent\n \nstate\n, and watches any properties on those instances for changes and intelligently refreshes the view when changes happen.\n\n\nNote that when requesting dependencies, Ringa JS is smart enough to look for the closest matching \nModel\n that matches the type you request.\n\n\nThe closest \nModel\n is defined as:\n\n\n\n\nRequest by type\n: a \nModel\n that is attached to the current Component or its nearest ancestor that is itself of the type requested or extends the type requested.\n\n\nRequest by name\n: a \nModel\n that is attached to the current Component or its nearest ancestor that has the name requested.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Ringa JS will give you a warning when in \n__DEV__: true\n mode if it encounters more than one Model that matches your requested dependency so that you can resolve this conflict if necessary.\n\n\ndepend()\n is the closest concept to binding that exists in Ringa JS. However, unlike other binding frameworks, Ringa JS provides considerable control over when updates take place and helps to ensure that there are no performance bottlenecks.\n\n\nNote that when you use \ndepend()\n the requested \nModel\n is added to the components \nstate\n by its name.\n\n\nExample 1 Request by Type\n\n\nimport {Model} from 'ringa'\nimport {attach, depend, dependency} from 'react-ringa';\n\nconst UserModel = Model.construct('UserModel', ['firstName', 'lastName']);\n\nclass User extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    depend(this, dependency(UserModel, ['firstName', 'lastName']));\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return \ndiv\n{this.state.firstName} {this.state.lastName}\n/div\n;\n  }\n}\n\nclass UserContainer extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    attach(this, new UserModel());\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return \nUser /\n;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nExample 1 Request by name\n\n\nimport {Model} from 'ringa'\nimport {attach, depend, dependency} from 'react-ringa';\n\nconst UserModel = Model.construct('UserModel', ['firstName', 'lastName']);\n\nclass User extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    depend(this, dependency('someCustomUserModelName', ['firstName', 'lastName']));\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return \ndiv\n{this.state.firstName} {this.state.lastName}\n/div\n;\n  }\n}\n\nclass UserContainer extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    attach(this, new UserModel('someCustomUserModelName'));\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return \nUser /\n;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not provide any dependencies, then every property on the \nModel\n is watched.\n\n\nIf your \nModel\n is structured in a tree, you can watch children models by using dot-syntax (e.g. \ndepend(this, dependency(AppModel, ['user.firstName']))\n)\n\n\nIf your \nModel\n is structured in a tree, you can watch children models and all of their properties by using star syntax (e.g. \ndepend(this, dependency(AppModel, ['user.*']))\n)\n\n\n\n\nArchitectural benefits to this approach:\n\n\n\n\nThere is no need to pass properties to children\n\n\nEach Component is responsible for determining when it needs to update itself\n\n\nBuild all your view components and wire them up after the fact\n\n\nEasy to provide custom injections for unit tests\n\n\nSplit your large application into submodules and the child modules do not need to know anything about the parent in order to request injections\n\n\nMove view components around easily without having to worry about touching ancestors\n\n\nNo singletons or god objects\n\n\n\n\n2.3. Watch a specific \nModel\n instance on a Component\n\n\nwatch(component, model, properties = [])\n\n\nIn some cases, you may already have access to a \nModel\n instance and want to immediately watch it so that the view refreshes when a property on the \nModel\n changes:\n\n\nimport {Model} from 'ringa'\nimport {watch} from 'react-ringa';\n\nconst PlaneModel = Model.construct('PlaneModel', ['altitude', 'speed']);\n\nclass Plane extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    this.planeModel = new PlaneModel();\n\n    watch(this, this.planeModel, ['altitude', 'speed']);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const {altitude, speed} = this.state;\n\n    return \ndiv\n\n      \nspan\nAltitude: {altitude}\n/span\n\n      \nspan\nSpeed: {speed}\n/span\n\n      \nbutton onClick={this.fasterAndHigher_onClickHandler}\nGo faster and higher!\n/button\n\n    \n/div\n;\n  }\n\n  fasterAndHigher_onClickHandler() {\n    this.planeModel.altitude += 10;\n    this.planeModel.speed++;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nIn the above example, when \naltitude\n or \nspeed\n change, those properties are automatically watched and the view is refreshed.\n\n\nNote that Ringa JS is smart enough to only perform one view refresh even though two properties are being updated.\n\n\n2.4. Performance\n\n\nBy default, React does an incredibly good job of ensuring that only DOM nodes are updated that need to be. However, because React was built from the ground up to expect that parents will pass properties to their children, if you are passing all properties to children and one of those properties changes, then this will trigger a call to \nrender()\n on all of the children that see the property has changed - even if they do not themselves need to be re-rendered.\n\n\nThankfully React 16 has made a ton of improvements to ensure that the lifecycle of Component updates is top-notch. The new scheduling paradigm has made things even better.\n\n\nRinga JS naturally integrates with React because of the unique way it tells React when to rerender a Component.\n\n\nWhenever you \ndepend\n or \nwatch\n in Ringa JS and a watched property changes, the property is added to a batch of properties to be updated the next frame via \nsetState\n. As a result you could watch dozens of properties and set all of them and only one \nsetState\n would be called by Ringa.\n\n\nIn addition, because each Component is responsible for saying what \nModel\n it needs and exactly which properties should trigger an update, parent components do not need to hold the responsibility of changing properties on their children to trigger a redraw.\n\n\nWe have discovered that Ringa JS works insanely fast with React (both 15 and 16) with literally thousands of React Components and bindings on the screen at once and only takes milliseconds to do large updates.\n\n\nAll of that said, performance bottlenecks still happen. Ringa JS has a built in warnings when it encounters performance issues. In addition every step of the process from setting a property on a \nModel\n to how it updates the display can be customized for maximum leverage over your applications lifecycle.",

Construction\n\n\nModel(name, values)\n\n\n\nThe Ringa \nModel\n constructor takes in an optional \nname\n string and optional \nvalues\n object. If the first property is an \nObject\n then it is assumed to be the \nvalues\n object.\n\n\nEvery new Ringa \nModel\n instance has the following base properties:\n\n\n\n\nid\n: inherited from \nRingaObject\n, a unique identifier for this model. A console warning will be issued if two \nRingaObjects\n contain the same id so try not to reuse these (although it is necessary in some cases due to cloning). By default \nid\n is the Model class Constructor name followed by a number that is the number of Models that have been created so far for this type.\n\n\nname\n: a human-readable name for the model. It is assumed that more than one model may have the same name. By default the \nname\n property is the Model class Constructor name in camelcase.\n\n\n_values\n: passed in to the constructor, these are optional defaults for each property. Note that the values are stored in the \n_values\n property, not \nvalues\n since they are to be treated as protected members.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the example \nUserModel\n class above we could do the following:\n\n\nlet userModel = new UserModel();\n\nconsole.log(`id: ${userModel.id}`);\nconsole.log(`name: ${userModel.name}`);\nconsole.log(`_values: ${userModel._values}`);\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nid: UserModel1\nname: userModel\n_values: undefined\n\n\n\nThe only way to set the \nid\n property through the constructor is to use the \nvalues\n argument. The reason for this is that often you want to instantiate a model from a POJO that contains the id:\n\n\nlet userModel = new UserModel({\n  id: 'someCustomId'\n});\n\nconsole.log(`id: ${userModel.id}`);\nconsole.log(`_values:`, userModel._values);\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nid: someCustomId\n_values: {id: 'someCustomId'}\n\n\n\nIf you desire to have your properties initialized immediately with different values than the Class defaults, you can provide those properties through the \nvalues\n object as well:\n\n\nlet me = new UserModel('joshuaJung', {\n  firstName: \"Joshua\",\n  lastName: \"Jung\"\n});\n\n\n\n1.1. \nModel.construct\n convenience syntax\n\n\nModel.construct(className, propertyArray)\n\n\n\nWhen building smaller models, a convenience method is provided which allows you to construct a \nclass\n from an array of properties.\n\n\nTo construct our \nUserModel\n class above we could do:\n\n\nimport {Model} from 'ringa';\n\nconst UserModel = Model.construct('UserModel', ['firstName', 'lastName', 'email']);\n\n\n\n1.2. Properties\n\n\nYou add properties to a Model with the \naddProperty\n method:\n\n\naddProperty(name, defaultValue, options);\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n: the name of the property.\n\n\ndefaultValue\n: the default value of the property.\n\n\noptions\n: a variety of options on how the property works. Discussed in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1. Property Names\n\n\naddProperty\n automatically constructs a getter / setter on your Model instance and internally stores the value of the property in the underscored name:\n\n\nclass MyModel extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('someProperty');\n  }\n}\n...\nlet myModel = new MyModel();\nmyModel.someProperty = 'to be or not to be';\n\nconsole.log(myModel._someProperty);\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nto be or not to be\n\n\n\nNode: a future version of Ringa should attach the getter / setter for properties to the internal \nprototype\n for performance if possible.\n\n\n1.2.2. Property Defaults\n\n\nYou can specify default values for \nModel\n properties easily:\n\n\nclass Airplane extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('altitude', 0);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAll properties in the \nModel\n default to \nundefined\n. In this case, we are saying the altitude should start, as it should, at \n0\n.\n\n\nlet airplane = new Airplane();\n\nconsole.log(airplane.altitude);\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n1.2.3. Property Options\n\n\nThe third parameter to \naddProperty\n is an optional options \nObject\n:\n\n\nclass Airplane extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('altitude', 0, {\n      description: 'This is the altitude of the airplane.'\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nAll property options can be accessed through the \npropertyOptions\n dictionary:\n\n\nlet airplane = new Airplane();\n\nconsole.log(airplane.propertyOptions.altitude.description);\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nThis is the altitude of the airplane.\n\n\n\nBe careful! If you accidentally pass the property options as the second parameter to \naddProperty\n they will be treated as the default value.\n\n\nNote: the following propertyOptions have special functions in Ringa and will be discussed further in the following docs:\n\n\n\n\ndescriptor\n\n\nsetParentModel\n\n\nautowatch\n\n\ndoNotNotify\n\n\nclone\n\n\ntype\n\n\nserialize\n\n\nget\n\n\nset\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4. Property Getters / Setters\n\n\nBy default, Ringa uses \nObject.defineProperty\n every time you call \naddProperty()\n to create a custom getter / setter on your model.\n\n\nHowever, you can override this quite easily:\n\n\nimport {Model} from 'ringa';\n\nclass UserModel extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('address', undefined, {\n      set: value =\n {\n        this._address = value ? value.toUpperCase();\n        this.notify('address');\n      },\n      get: () =\n {\n        return this._address;\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNote: if you override the internal setter you will not get any of the built in notification features unless you call them yourself!\n\n\n1.3. Watching\n\n\nModel's can be watched for property value changes or even custom signals.\n\n\nNote: signals are similar to lightweight events but are not the same! Signals are only a string and do not contain a detail object. In addition signals are automatically dispatched through the ancestors of a model so that parent models can listen when properties of their children change.\n\n\nUsing the Example Class \nUserModel\n defined at the beginning of this page, we could do the following:\n\n\nlet user = new UserModel();\n\nuser.watch(signal =\n {\n  console.log(`A property has changed '${signal}': ${user[signal]}`);\n});\n\nuser.firstName = 'Saajan';\n\n\n\nThe console will now output:\n\n\nA property has changed 'firstName': Saajan\n\n\n\n1.4. Watch Until\n\n\nModel's can be watched until a condition is met. One use case might be if you have an authorization model with a flag for being logged in. Your view could \nwatchUntil\n the user is logged in before continuing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwatchUntil(condition, handler, autoUnwatch = true)\n\n\nclass AuthModel = Model.construct('AuthModel', ['loggedIn']);\n\n\n...\n\n\nlet authModel = new AuthModel(); //\n\n\nauthModel.watchUntil(authModel =\n authModel.loggedIn, signal =\n {\n  console.log(\nThe user has logged in!\n);\n}, true);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternally the model watches all of its dispatched signals and reruns the condition check function every time. When it is truthy, then the handler is called.\n\n\nIf you set \nautoUnwatch\n to true, then the handler will only be called the first time the condition is met. If \nautoUnwatch\n is false, then the handler function will be called every time the condition is met.\n\n\n2. Advanced\n\n\nWhile all the following features are optional, they are all designed to work together seamlessly to serve every need you could have for a Model. For the best results, I recommend reading on each of the following features to get the most mileage and reuse from your Ringa models.\n\n\n2.1. Cloning\n\n\nRinga \nModels\n can easily be cloned:\n\n\nlet userModel = new UserModel();\n\nlet clonee = userModel.clone();\n\n\n\nIn some cases you may not want to clone the \nid\n and instead want the cloned object to grab a new unique identifier:\n\n\nlet clonee = userModel.clone({\n  cloneId: false\n});\n\nconsole.log(clonee.id);\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nUserModel2\n\n\n\nNote: in 2.3 we will explain how Ringa models can be structured like a tree. The \nclone()\n method is recursive on all descendants.\n\n\n2.2. Serialization\n\n\nEvery Ringa \nModel\n has highly customizable built-in serialization and deserialization. By default both serialization and deserialization are recursive in a \nModel\n tree (see section 2.3).\n\n\nBy default, only properties that have been added with \naddProperty\n are serialized or deserialized. \n\n\n2.2.1. Serializing\n\n\nTo serialize a Ringa \nModel\n:\n\n\nlet pojo = myModel.serialize();\n\n\n\nThere are lots of options for serializing Ringa models:\n\n\n\n\nOverride the \nserializeId\n getter on any \nModel\n to customize the \nid\n property for serialization.\n\n\nImplement the \nserializeProperties\n getter on any \nModel\n to return an Array of properties to be serialized for that \nModel\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nclass MyModel extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('text', 'hello world');\n    this.addProperty('hiddenText', 'we refuse to be serialized');\n  }\n\n  get serializeId() {\n    return this.id + '_serialized';\n  }\n\n  get serializeProperties() {\n    return ['text']; // Not necessary to include id\n  }\n}\n...\nconsole.log(new MyModel().serialize());\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"MyModel1_serialized\",\n  \"text\": \"hello world\"\n}\n\n\n\n2.2.2. Deserializing\n\n\nBasic deserialization is easy. Assuming the \nUserModel\n example used at the beginning of this page:\n\n\nlet pojo = {\n  id: \"12345678\",\n  firstName: \"Joseph\",\n  lastName: \"Williams\",\n  email: \"jwilliams@somewhere.com\"\n};\n\nlet userModel = Model.deserialize(pojo, {\n  type: UserModel\n});\n\n\n\nModel.deserialize\n will instantiate a new \nUserModel\n instance and populate each of its properties with values from the POJO (if they exist).\n\n\nFor simple cases this is sufficient. However, with trees of models, deserialization can be a lot more complicated. Since the serialized JSON object does not include information on what type of Javascript model it should be serialized back into, you need\nto provide the information yourself.\n\n\nThis can be done in several ways:\n\n\n\n\nProvide a \ntype\n option for the root model\n\n\nSet \ntype\n on the property option (for properties)\n\n\nProvide a \nmodelMapper\n \nFunction\n to the deserialize options.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.1. Deserializing: \ntype\n option\n\n\nAs shown above, you can provide a \ntype\n property to the deserialize options:\n\n\nlet myModel = Model.deserialize(pojo, {\n  type: MyModel\n});\n\n\n\nNote that the type provided must extend \nModel\n.\n\n\n2.2.2.2. Deserializing: \ntype\n property option\n\n\nFor individual properties, you can specify the type when calling \naddProperty\n (including Arrays) and deserialization will instantiate a new \nModel\n of that type and deserialize into it:\n\n\nclass FamilyTreeNode extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('quote');\n\n    this.addProperty('children', undefined, {\n      type: FamilyTreeNode\n    });\n  }\n}\n...\nlet pojo = {\n  quote: \"I'm a father of two children!\",\n  children: [{\n    quote: \"I hate dad jokes.\"\n  }, {\n    quote: \"I, also, hate dad jokes.\"\n  }]\n};\n\nlet myModel = Model.deserialize(pojo, {\n  type: FamilyTreeNode\n});\n\n\n\nIn this case, three instances of \nFamilyTreeNode\n will be constructed, and two of them will exist inside of the \nchildren\n property of the parent node.\n\n\n2.2.2.3. Deserializing: \nmodelMapper\n option\n\n\nIn some cases, you may have a large tree of models and you are not sure beforehand what the types passed in will be. As a result you may\nneed to inspect the JSON object for custom indicators to determine its type.\n\n\nFor this situation, you can use the \nmodelMapper\n \nFunction\n option:\n\n\nclass TextModel {...};\nclass NumberModel {...};\n\nlet modelMapper = (pojo, options) =\n {\n  if (pojo.hasOwnProperty('text') {\n    return TextModel;\n  } else if (pojo.hasOwnProperty('number') {\n    return NumberModel;\n  }\n};\n\nlet somePojo = {...};\nlet myModel = Model.deserialize(somePojo, {modelMapper});\n\n\n\nIn this example, if \nsomePojo\n has a property named \ntext\n then the deserializer will make a new \nTextModel\n. If it has a property named \nnumber\n then the deserializer will\nmake a \nNumberModel\n.\n\n\nNote: the \nmodelMapper\n is passed recursively in the same options object to all descendants that are deserialized as well.\n\n\n2.3. Trees\n\n\nRinga Models are designed to be linked together in tree structures to make monitoring changes in a large collection of models easier.\n\n\nIn addition, this structure allows you to serialize, deserialize, index, and clone large recursive model structures with ease.\n\n\n2.3.1. Autowatching and linking child \nModels\n\n\nEvery \nModel\n object watches each property for changes and if a property is set to another \nModel\n object then an internal tree structure is automatically created:\n\n\nclass TreeNode extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('child');\n    this.addProperty('text');\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\nlet parent = new TreeNode('parent');    \nlet child = new TreeNode();\n\nparent.child = child;\n\nconsole.log('Parent is:', child.parentModel.name);\nconsole.log('Children are:', parent.childIdToRef);\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nParent is: parent\nChildren are:\n{\n  TreeNode2: TreeNode\n}\n\n\n\nIn addition to watching their properties and linking to their child \nModels\n, every \nModel\n by default watches every single child \nModel\n for property changes and dispatches a dot-notation signal when any descendant has a change:\n\n\n...\nparent.watch(signal =\n console.log);\n\nchild.text = 'Hello World';\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nchild.text\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this structure is so that you can create incredibly complex model trees (like an intricate layered form) and listen for changes from any node in the entire tree and respond to the change.\n\n\nFor example, imagine a complex Form with groups and nodes. If you watch the root node, anytime a property anywhere in the tree changes at any node, you could trigger a validation method or an auto-save to the database without having to explicitly watch every single node in the tree or even know the size of the tree.\n\n\n2.3.2. Watching child \nModels\n in Arrays or Objects\n\n\nNote that for Arrays or Objects, in the current version you will need to manually link children to their parents. To do so you call \naddModelChild\n:\n\n\nclass TreeNode extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('children');\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\nlet parent = new TreeNode('parent');    \nlet child = new TreeNode();\n\nparent.children = [child];\n\nparent.addModelChild('children', child);\n\n\n\nThe first argument to \naddModelChild\n is the property that the parent can find that child within.\n\n\nThe reason I left this to you as a manual exercise is so that no loops over children are done without your knowledge.\n\n\n2.4. Notifications / \nnotify()\n\n\nBy default, Ringa Models automatically dispatch (notify) a new signal that matches the property name when that property changes in value.\n\n\nuser.watch(signal =\n console.log);\n\nuser.firstName = 'Josh');\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nfirstName\n\n\n\nBut if the property does not change in value, then no signal is dispatched:\n\n\n// Signal 'firstName' is dispatched first time!\nuser.firstName = 'Saajan';\n\n// Signal 'firstName' is NOT dispatched, because property has not changed\nuser.firstName = 'Saajan';\n\n\n\nThe handler method for a notification has the following signature:\n\n\nmyModel.watch((signal, signaler, value, descriptor) =\n {});\n\n\n\n\n\nsignal\n: the String signal (e.g. \n'firstName'\n). Will match the property name that has changed by default.\n\n\nsignaler\n: the \nModel\n that dispatched the signal. Useful in Model trees.\n\n\nvalue\n: the value of the property that changed (if associated with a property).\n\n\ndescriptor\n: a plain-text description of the signal (intended for use with a history feature).\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1. Custom Notifications\n\n\nOne cool feature of the Ringa \nModel\n is that you can notify your own custom signals:\n\n\nlet user = new UserModel();\n\nuser.watch(signal =\n {\n  if (signal === 'update') {\n    doSomeHugeTask();\n  }\n});\n\nuser.firstName = 'Saajan';\nuser.lastName = 'Smith';\nuser.email = 'saajan@somewhere.com';\n\nuser.notify('update');\n\n\n\n2.4.2. Turning off Notifications\n\n\nFor the sake of performance, you can turn off notifications by using the property option \ndoNotNotify\n:\n\n\nimport {Model} from 'ringa';\n\nclass UserModel extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('firstName', {doNotNotify: true});\n    this.addProperty('lastName', {doNotNotify: true});\n  }\n\n  get fullName() {\n    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\nuser = new UserModel();\n\nuser.watch(signal =\n {\n  if (signal === 'change') {\n    console.log('The name has changed! ${user.fullName}');\n  }\n});\n\nuser.firstName = 'Saajan';\nuser.lastName = 'Smith';\n\nuser.notify('change');\n\n\n\nIn the above example, we notify a special event when either the \nfirstName\n or \nlastName\n has changed. This structure keeps the properties\n\nfirstName\n and \nlastName\n in the serialization, indexing, and cloning while reducing the overhead of notifications for each one which is especially noticeable\nin deeply nested trees of Models.\n\n\nAlso note that the property \nfullName\n - which may be useful in your view - is not included in the serialization / deserialization or cloning.\n\n\nThis is the standard way that I recommend implementing aggregate properties. \n\n\n2.5. Aggregate Properties\n\n\nA lot of observable frameworks like MobX and Angular attempt to deduce what you want updated by reading complex strings that combine filtering, sorting, etc. Many of\nthem do this by parsing the string, breaking it down into variable names, and then watching all the variables for updates.\n\n\nUnfortunately, at the beginning of a smaller project this is really helpful but it causes several problems especially as a project scales:\n\n\n\n\nBindings can begin to cause unpredicable performance drops when updating a single variable causes a huge tree of observables to be triggered.\n\n\nIncluding complex math or array reduce / map / filters inside of strings limits your IDEs ability to parse some of your most important code.\n\n\n\n\nMy goal with Ringa was to avoid these two problems as much as possible. As a result, the Models in Ringa give most of the power of these updates to you, the developer.\n\n\n2.6. Watching property changes with \nonChange\n\n\nIf you want to do complex operations, you can do so like this:\n\n\nimport {Model} from 'ringa';\n\nclass Collection extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('data');  // Input array (immutable)\n    this.addProperty('items', {\n      get: () {\n        return this.data ? this.data.filter(this.filter) : [];\n      }\n    }); // Output array (determined by filter)\n\n    this.addProperty('filter', {\n      onChange: (oldValue, newValue) =\n {\n        this.notify('items');\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNote: \nonChange\n only gets called if the value of the property \nfilter\n above actually changes to a new value.\n\n\nNow, when \nfilter\n changes, an \nitems\n signal will be dispatched:\n\n\nlet collection = new Collection();\n\ncollection.watch(signal =\n {\n  if (signal === 'items') {\n    console.log(\"Items are now: ${collection.items.join(',')}\");\n  }\n});\n\ncollection.data = [1, 2, 3];\ncollection.filter = value =\n value !== 2;\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\n1, 3\n\n\n\nThis notification feature of models is the foundation of the high performance of Ringa because nothing happens that you do not \nexplicitly tell Ringa to do, so you can avoid all the performance bottlenecks from the beginning that tend to bog down enterprise software.\n\n\n2.7 Indexing (Trie) and the \nindex\n option for search\n\n\nThe Ringa \nModel\n object allows you to index your models (recursively) using a fast-lookup \nTrie search\n. This is especially useful for type-ahead\nsearches:\n\n\nclass TextModel extends Model {\n  constructor(name, values) {\n    super(name, values);\n\n    this.addProperty('text', {index: true});\n\n    this.addProperty('children', {type: TextModel});\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\n// Assume that tree is a deeply nested tree of TextModel objects\n\ntree.index(true);\n\nlet arrayOfModelsThatHaveHello = tree.get('hello');\n\n\n\nIn this example, the call to \nindex()\n builds a new Trie internal to the root \ntree\n model. It indexes every single property that has been added with \nindex\n set to true.\n\n\nThe index method has the following signature:\n\n\nindex(recurse = false, trieSearchOptions = {}, trieSearch = undefined)\n\n\n\n\n\nrecurse\n: whether to recurse into child models and their indexed properties.\n\n\ntrieSearchOptions\n: these options will be passed into the Trie search. See the \ndocumentation\n for details.\n\n\ntrieSearch\n: if you want to provide your own instance of the Trie, you may pass it in here. If none is passed, a new one is constructed automatically.\n\n\n\n\nIndexing is not performed automatically, you must call \nindex()\n yourself. Also please do not call \nindex()\n more often than is necessary as building the indexing structure\nis time-intensive on large model trees.\n\n\nNote: the \naddIndexedPropery()\n method can be used instead of \naddProperty(name, {index:true})\n.",
